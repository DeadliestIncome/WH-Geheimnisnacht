ca_istrabul;Istrabul;;;;;;;;x
ca_istrabul_desc;From the Peacock Palace, the Sultan of Istrabul rules over one of the most wondrous cities of mankind. Istrabul is a city planned by the finest architects and built by combination of skilled labour and magical assistance. To Arabyans proper, it is an upstart, but none can deny the sparkling brilliance of the City of Man's Desire.;;;;;;;;x

#Bretonnia
tp_shallya_centre;The Great Temple of Shallya;;;;;;;;x
tp_shallya_centre_desc;The Bleeding Heart of Shallya's Cult is in Couronne. Although the Cult attracts many worshippers and is wealthy, the cultists are uninterested in politics and rarely use their influence.;;;;;;;;x
tp_enchantress_chapel;The Chapel of the Enchantress;;;;;;;;x
tp_enchantress_chapel_desc;Rumour has it that this exquisite Grail Chapel is visited by the Fay Enchantress herself. Such tales ensure a steady stream of pilgrims to Quenelles.;;;;;;;;x
ct_bretonnian_wine_trade_1;Rudimentary Wine Trade;;;;;;;;x
ct_bretonnian_wine_trade_2;Successful Wine Trade;;;;;;;;x
ct_bretonnian_wine_trade_3;Famous Wine Trade;;;;;;;;x
ct_bretonnian_wine_trade_desc;Wine is the national drink of Bretonnia and its vinyards produce in great quantity and quality. Indeed, finding bad wine in the country is almost impossible! Though other goods are exported, wine is the lifeblood of Bretonnia's export trade.;;;;;;;;x

#The Empire
tp_manann_centre;The Great Temple of Manann;;;;;;;;x
tp_manann_centre_desc;The centre of the Manannite Cult is Marienburg. Much of the cult's fabulous wealth flows to the Great Temple, giving the high priests significant temporal power and prestige.;;;;;;;;x
tp_sacred_flame;The Sacred Flame of Ulric;;;;;;;;x
tp_sacred_flame_desc;Middenheim is home to the Great Temple of Ulric. The centre of the Cult's worship is the sacred flame, but the temple is more fortress than shrine. Its immensely strong walls shelter a vast army of Ulrican templars, all willing to fight and die at the order of the Ar-Ulric.;;;;;;;;x

#The Moot
ca_grandmoot;General Moot;;;;;;;;x
ca_grandmoot_desc;Unlike the other capitals of the Empire, Eicheschatten is a humble but exceedingly comfortable town, well-suited to the Halfling race. Every three years, a General Moot of all Halflings gathers here to choose a new Elder and decide on matters of Halfling justice.;;;;;;;;x
ca_three_smoke_rings;The Three Smoke Rings;;;;;;;;x
ca_three_smoke_rings_desc;Most of the Mootland's tobacco is produced in Gipfel. Although this sleepy town is small enough that its main tavern, the Three Smoke Rings, also doubles as a government building, but its population is swollen by traders from across the Old World during harvest time.;;;;;;;;x
ca_sauerapfel;Sauerapfel;;;;;;;;x
ca_sauerapfel_desc;Sauerapfel is the main port of the Mootland. Many of its inhabitants are outward-looking "adventuring Halflings", and even those who stay in town think of themselves as more sophisticated than other Mootlanders. This attitude wins them few friends elsewhere in the Moot!;;;;;;;;x

#Estalia
ca_alhamra;The Alhamra Palace;;;;;;;;x
ca_alhamra_desc;The foundations of Alhamra were built during the years of Arabyan occuption, when Sultan Jaffar believed he would need a fine residence for his new conquest. After the Reconquista, the Kings of Astarios took over the site and finished it, creating an elegant palace for their dynasty. Alhamra's fusion of Arabyan and traditional Estalian architecture symbolises the diverse character of Astarios.;;;;;;;;x
ca_cap_i_casal;Cap i Casal;;;;;;;;x
ca_cap_i_casal_desc;The Cap i Casal (head and home) of the Kings of Tigarre is a magnificent palace in Northern Estalia. Unlike the southern Kings, the monarchs of Tigarre never had to abandon their ancient residence during the Arabyan invasion. Indeed, many of the beautiful works of art housed within the Cap i Casal were rushed away from the south ahead of Jaffar's armies.;;;;;;;;x
tp_estalian_inquisition;The Estalian Inquisition;;;;;;;;x
tp_estalian_inquisition_desc;The armies of Bretonnia and the Empire give Estalia some protection from the overt threat of Chaos. For more subtle threats, the Estalian realms rely on the Sacred Office of Myrmidia's Inquisition, based in the holy city Magritta.;;;;;;;;x
tp_tomb_of_santiago;Tomb of Santiago;;;;;;;;x
tp_tomb_of_santiago_desc;During the dark years of the Arabyan invasion, Santiago de Vivar was the Champion of Estalia. His victories helped to slow the Arabyan tide and established his reputation as an invincible leader. In Santiago's final battle, he was slain by a poison arrow but even in death his body led a triumphant charge from the back of his faithful warhorse. His tomb is one of the holiest places in Estalia and many templar knights visit to draw strength from the spirit of Santiago.;;;;;;;;x
tp_our_lady_cervantes;Our Lady of Cervantes;;;;;;;;x
tp_our_lady_cervantes_desc;Our Lady of Cervantes is a large temple complex built to commemorate the appearance of Myrmidia to beleagured Estalian troops during the early days of the Arabyan invasion. Inspired by their goddess, the Estalians rallied and won an important victory, delaying the northward march of Jaffar's legions. After the Reconquista, Our Lady of Cervantes has become an important centre of pilgrimage for the Myrmidian faithful.;;;;;;;;x

#Tilea
ca_acropolis;The Acropolis of Luccini;;;;;;;;x
ca_acropolis_desc;Luccini is the great city of Southern Tilea. Great armies of pikemen march under the Leopard banner of its princes and merchants flock to the city's markets. But Luccini is also a religious center, with many temples standing atop the Acropolis at the city's heart.;;;;;;;;x
tp_raventheatre;The Theatre of Ravens;;;;;;;;x
tp_raventheatre_desc;The priests of Morr have little formal organisation, but they all recognise Luccini as the centre of their faith. Here, under the great dome of the Theatre of Ravens, Morrian priests, monks, and knights gather from across the Old World to discuss the problems of their Cult. A substantial barrack house of Black Guards provides security for the assembled cultists.;;;;;;;;x
ca_monte_castello;Monte Castello;;;;;;;;x
ca_monte_castello_desc;Built on the ruins of an ancient Elven citadel, strengthened by Dwarf masons, and manned by some of the toughest mercenaries in the Old World: Monte Castello is one of the most formidable fortresses in Tilea.;;;;;;;;x
ca_pavona;Pavona;;;;;;;;x
ca_pavona_desc;Small but elegant, Pavona is famous for the many bridges which allow its privileged upper class to spend their lives literally above the common masses.;;;;;;;;x
ca_trantio;Trantio;;;;;;;;x
ca_trantio_desc;Trantio is a relative newcomer to the games of the Tilean Princes. For centuries it was a backwater, isolated from the main trade routes and only able to secure its independence from Remas and Miragliano by masterfully playing one off against the other. In more recent times the explorer Marco Colombo installed himself as Prince and wisely invested Lustrian treasure in the city. What next for Trantio?;;;;;;;;x
ct_towers_of_verezzo;The Towers of Verezzo;;;;;;;;x
ct_towers_of_verezzo_desc;Many prosperous cities outgrow their walls. In Verezzo's case, the solution has been to build up, rather than out, creating the tallest city in the realms of men. The towers of the Verezzan elite can be seen from miles around. Architects and engineers rarely want for work in this inventive city.;;;;;;;;x
tp_mount_of_myrmidia;The Mount of Myrmidia;;;;;;;;x
tp_mount_of_myrmidia_desc;This gigantic walled citadel is the largest temple of Myrmidia in Tilea. With its own guards, an army of templar knights, and vast political influence, the temple is effectively a state-within-a-state.;;;;;;;;x

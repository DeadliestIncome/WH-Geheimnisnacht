Integrated Mods and Stand-Alone Work

  - Amazon code taken from the mod "Return of the Amazons" by Careful Plum##
  - Still working on contributing them all but inspiration and code examples from many places were used in the creation of this work.
    Development has spanned a decade and it will not be possible to know where every line of code originated.
    So in general thank you to the entire Paradox modding community for all of the help and information.
    This couldn't have happened without all of you.
